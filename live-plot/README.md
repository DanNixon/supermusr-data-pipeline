# live-plot

A very quick and dirty tool that plots traces from a single digitiser channel.

Essentially the result of hackily conjoining the code from [stream-to-file](../stream-to-file) and the [Plotters console backend example](https://github.com/plotters-rs/plotters/blob/master/plotters/examples/console.rs).
